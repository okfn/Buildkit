# These are dependencies that are already in Lucid and should be installed via
# apt-get if you are on that platform. If you are using a different platform
# you can install these dependencies via pip instead.
#
# Note:
#
#     Developers, our build script for the Debian packages relies on the 
#     requirements above being specified as editable resources with their
#     mercurial, SVN or git repository specified at the correct revision to
#     package, or as packages on pypi.python.org with an == sign. Other 
#     formats such as >, <, <= or >= are not supported.
#
# Here are some examples:
#
#     babel==0.9.4
#     psycopg2==2.0.13
#     lxml==2.2.4
#     sphinx==0.6.4
#     # Specifying particular version of WebOb because later version has incompatibility
#     # with pylons 0.9.7 (change to imports of Multidict)
#     webob==1.0.8
#     Pylons==0.9.7
#     repoze.who==1.0.18
#     tempita==0.4
#     zope.interface==3.5.3
#     # These are both combined into the python-repoze.who-plugins package
#     repoze.who.plugins.openid
#     # Actually from python-repoze.who-plugins but the openid plugin in the same
#     # package is too old
#     repoze.who-friendlyform==1.0.8
#     routes==1.11
#     paste==1.7.2
#     pastescript==1.7.3
