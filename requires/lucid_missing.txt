# These are packages that we rely on that aren't present in Lucid. We package
# them and put them in our own CKAN repository
#
# Note:
#
#     Developers, our build script for the Debian packages relies on the 
#     requirements above being specified as editable resources with their
#     mercurial, SVN or git repository specified at the correct revision to
#     package, or as packages on pypi.python.org with an == sign. Other 
#     formats such as >, <, <= or >= are not supported.
#
# Here are some examples (note that we put the equivalent requirement in a
# comment):
# 
#     licenses==0.4
#     # pyutilib.component.core>=4.1,<4.1.99
#     -e svn+https://software.sandia.gov/svn/public/pyutilib/pyutilib.component.core/trunk@1972#egg=pyutilib.component.core
#     # FormAlchemy
#     -e git+https://github.com/FormAlchemy/formalchemy.git@1.3.9#egg=formalchemy
