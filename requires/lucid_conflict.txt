# These are packages where we require a different version of a package from
# the one in Lucid. Rather than packaging a backport which could potentially
# interfere with a user's other installed software, we put these modules into
# a single location which is imported from in preference to the Lucid 
# equivalent.
#
# Note:
#
#     Developers, our build script for the Debian packages relies on the 
#     requirements above being specified as editable resources with their
#     mercurial, SVN or git repository specified at the correct revision to
#     package, or as packages on pypi.python.org with an == sign. Other 
#     formats such as >, <, <= or >= are not supported.
# 
# Some examples:
#
#       Genshi>=0.6,<0.6.99
#       -e hg+http://hg.saddi.com/flup@301a58656bfb#egg=flup
